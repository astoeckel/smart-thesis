\section{Some math}

\marginnote{This formula is also known as \emph{Pythagorean Theorem}, albeit it is usually written with the variables $a$, $b$, and $c$.}
Here follows some tests for typesetting math. Note how we use the \texttt{\\marginnote} command to add some pretty notes which appear in the margin. This is quite nice, as it allows a more narrow width of the text body without the page looking too sparse\footnote{This is a footnote}. Here comes our first equation
\begin{align}
  z^2 &= x^2 + y^2 \\
  z &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \,.
\end{align}

\pagebreak
\marginnote{Did you know? The discrete fourier transformation shown in equation \ref{eqn:dft} is the backbone of the modern information-society.}
And here comes some more math, this time a discrete Fourier transformation (DFT)  which is a little bit more sophisticated than the last example\footnote{More is always better!}:
\begin{align}
	f_m =  \sum_{k=0}^{2n-1} x_k \, e^{-\frac{2\pi i}{2n} mk } \label{eqn:dft}
\qquad
m = 0,\dotsc,2n-1 \,.
\end{align}
For words of science, see \cite{botsch2010polygon}. Unfortunately, that book has nothing about \glspl{wolf}.

\section{Even more tests}

\marginnote{Blood-red were his spurs i' the golden noon; wine-red was his velvet coat, when they shot him down on the highway, down like a dog on the highway, and he lay in his blood on the highway, with the bunch of lace at his throat.}
